Project: Password Cracking Lab (John the Ripper)
Objective: Test password strength and hashes
Tools: John the Ripper, Kali Linux

Steps:
1 Create hashed passwords:
  echo -n "123456789" | openssl passwd -1 >> hashes.txt

2. Run John the Ripper:
   john hashes.txt

3. Observe cracked passwords

4. Document time-to-crack

Observations:
- Weak passwords like "123456789" and "password123" cracked immediately
- Stronger passwords were harder to crack

Recommendations:
- Use long, complex passwords with a minimum of 10 characters. Include a combination numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters as well as special charaters.
- Hash passwords with salt
