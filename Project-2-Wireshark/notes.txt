Project: Traffic Capture & Analysis (Wireshark)
Objective: Capture and analyze network traffic
Tools: Kali Linux, Wireshark

Steps:
1. Open Wireshark:
   -sudo wireshark

2. Select interface (wlan0 or eth0 depending on the VM setup):
   -eth0 was selected  for monitoring live traffic.

3. Start capture:
   - Began capturing packets. No traffic appeared until network activity started.

4. Generate traffic by browsing websites:
   - Opened Firefox and visited http://example.com follwed by https://www.google.com.
   - These actions produced DNS queries, DNS responses and HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
   - Packets began appearing immediately after loading the sites.

5. Generate additional traffic using ping:
   - The command used is ping -c 4 google.com
   - This introduced clear ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets into the capture.

6. Apply protocol filters:
   - HTTP: http
     Displayed HTTP GET requests and server responses
   - DNS: dns
     Showed DNS queries (example.com) and their corresponding A-record responses.
   - ICMP: icmp
     Isolated ping traffic (Echo Requests and Echo Replies).

7. Analyze packet details:
   - DNS packets contained query names and resoved IP addresses.
   - HTTP packets showed GET requests, headers and server responses.
   - ICMP traffic displayed Type 0 (Echo Reply).
  Protocol layers inspected included: Ethernet, TCP and Application Layer sections.

8. Save Capture:
   - File saved as traffic_cature.pcapng

Observations:
- DNS queries and responses were captured when visiting ggogle.com and example.com.
- HTTP GET requests were observed clearly before pinging.
- ICMP traffic appeared later after running the ping command.
- Using filters made it easy to isolate specific protocols and study their headers and behavior.
