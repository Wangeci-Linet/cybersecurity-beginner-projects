Project: Network Scanning & Mapping (Nmap)
Objective: Perform reconnaissance on a local network
Tool: Kali Linux, Nmap

Steps & Observations:
1. Find local IP address01:
   - Command used was `ip a`
   - Under eth0 my IP network range was 10.0.2.15/24

2. Ping sweep to find live hosts:
   - sudo nmap -sn 10.0.2.15/24
   - Found hosts 10.0.2.2, 10.0.2.3, 10.0.2.15

3. SYN scan to detect open ports:
   - sudo nmap -sS 10.0.2.2
   - Open ports 135 (TCP), 3306 (TCP)

4. Service detection:
   - sudo nmap -sV 10.0.2.2
   - Port : 3306/tcp
     Service: mysql
     Version: MySQL 8.0.43

5. OS detection:
   - sudo nmap -O 10.0.2.2
   - The target machine is running inside VirtualBox using NAT mode. NAT interferes with OS fingerprinting and the VM did not expose enough open/closed ports for detection.

Recommendations:
- Close unused ports.
- Keep services updated.
